flask translate init LANG (add new language)
flask translate update (to update language repos)
flask translate compile (to compile language repos)

babel export (this step won't be shortcutted into command, because it makes the other commands available)

cli script will delete the messages.pot file, apparently this file can be easily generated again

to add new language:
venv> flask translate init <langauge-code>

to update all the langauges after making changes to the _() and _l() langauge markers:
venv> flask translate update

to compile langauges after updating the translation files:
flask translate compile

let's test this by adding another small translation to base.html (Username in logged out)
works good. 
One very important notice:
if two marked strings are equal in a template, they both will be next to placed next to each other in pot file.
