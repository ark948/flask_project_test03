it would be useful to know the region and timezone of users.

update the user model later.

- add a last_seen or some sort of a time column to one of the models.

test the flask-moment library by displaying the time.

(in our server only utc is stored, and it will be convereted to the correct format when users from different regions bring it up.)

as long as there is no time field in any of the models, i am not sure how we can test this thing.
let's try adding a simple right now time to base.html...
OK, it works.
