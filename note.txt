1. not going to use set FLASK_APP
instead try manually to run the app
result: works fine, so far no problem

2. added database, added migrate object
ran flask db init without setting FLASK_APP
result: works fine, so far no problem. migrations folder was added successfully
update: one small problem. forgot to register sqlalchemy db object with app -> main init -> db.init_app(app=app)
issue was fixed easily. database file created successfully.

3. tried to run flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
problem: no migration script was created.
problem was fixed by importing models at env.py of the alembic
# target_metadata = mymodel.Base.metadata

from app.models.user import User
another problem: should i now delete migrate.init_db in main init?
also migration script adjusted in password_hash field -> nullable attribute

4. tried to run flask db upgrade
result: seems to be no problem, needs to be tested later...
test data: user1 test@test.com 123
user2 test2@test.com 1
test3 test3@test.com 1

5. flask-login requires user model to have some certain attributes implemented. this can be done manually or using the provided mixin class. also user loader function must be added

6. make a .flaskenv file for flask's config vars, and a .env for app config vars.
.flaskenv can added to source control
.env should not because it contains prodcution deployment stuff
